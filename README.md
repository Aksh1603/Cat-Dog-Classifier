# cat-dog-flask
cat dog neural network implemented into website using flask
===========================================================

My project employs Python's CNN architecture to create a robust cat-dog classifier. Users can easily upload an image, and the trained model accurately identifies whether it contains a cat or a dog. By processing images through convolutional layers, the model learns to extract relevant features, enabling precise classification. This project showcases the power of deep learning in image recognition tasks, offering a practical application of computer vision technology.
